Do u konw that ?we 've got a so called "class flower" in front of me by several rows.      i have to admit that she is some kind of a beauty .But i don't interested in and appreciate her at all ,for one reason importantly is i've already got a GF (although i don't think this emotion between us can last for ever or long ,but i have to try ..), for the other reason ,i don't think those girls are not vulgar badly .In fact ,nowadays ,more and more girls' Several days before is Mid-Autumn Day , so i hope this festival doesn't lose it's own meaning . In Song Dynasty a poet named SUSHI expressed his emotion by saying " I wish everyone could live a long life and get together by heart no matter how far they were ".</textarea>
